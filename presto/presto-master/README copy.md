- A button should be accessible on every slideshow deck (either immediately, or behind a control panel) that brings up the version history page.
- This should show a list of moments in history such that users can "restore", which restores all slides in the deck to a previous state.
- These previous state moments should be captured by you on every modification of the slideshow deck that occurs with a minimum of 1 minute between saves.
